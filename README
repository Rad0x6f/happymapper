= happymapper

== DESCRIPTION:

Object to xml mapping library. I have included examples to help get you going. The specs
should also point you in the right direction.

== FEATURES:

* Easy to define xml attributes and elements for an object
* Fast because it uses libxml-ruby under the hood
* Automatic conversion of xml to defined objects
* Reusable classes via a node finding mechanism that searches by 1. specified tag,
2. name of element, 3. class name. (gemspec was upgraded to 0.3.0 for this change)

== SYNOPSIS:

See examples directory in the gem to get a feel for how it works.

== INSTALL:

* add github to your sources if you haven't gem sources -a http://gems.github.com
* sudo gem install jnunemaker-happymapper
* sudo gem install happymapper (when rubyforge approves and i release there)
